CARL is built on top of other environments and benchmarks, extending them
to contextual reinforcement learning environments.

Specifically, we used the works of:

`OpenAI gym, Brockman et al., 2016. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01540.pdf>`_

`Brax -- A Differentiable Physics Engine for Large Scale
Rigid Body Simulation, Freeman et al., NeurIPS 2021 (Dataset & 
Benchmarking Track) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13281.pdf>`_

`TOAD-GAN: Coherent Style Level Generation from a Single Example,
Awiszus et al., AIIDE 2020 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01531.pdf>`_

`Learning to Design RNA, Runge et al., ICRL 2019 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11951.pdf>`_

For insights into cRL, we recommend our CARL paper as well as:

CARL is built on top of other environments and benchmarks, extending them
to contextual reinforcement learning environments.

Specifically, we used the works of:

[OpenAI gym, Brockman et al., 2016. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01540.pdf)

[Brax -- A Differentiable Physics Engine for Large Scale 
Rigid Body Simulation, Freeman et al., NeurIPS 2021 (Dataset & 
Benchmarking Track)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13281.pdf)

For insights into cRL, we recommend our CARL paper as well as:

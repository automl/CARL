CARL Brax Environments
######################
In CARL all `Brax locomotion environments <https://github.com/google/brax>`_ are included.
As context features there are external features like gravity or friction or internal features
like joint strength or torso mass.


CARL Ant Environment
***************************

Here the agent needs to learn how to control a four-legged ant in order
to run (quickly) into a given direction.

CARL Fetch Environment
**********************

Fetch trains a robotic dog to run to a target location.
The target radius and distance as well as physical properties can be varied via the context features.

CARL Grasp Environment
**********************

In CARL Grasp the agent is trained to pick up an object with a robot hand.
Three bodies are observed by Grasp: 'Hand', 'Object', and 'Target'.
When Object reaches Target, the agent is rewarded.
Apart from Grasp's pyhiscal properties the target radius, height and distance are also varied.

CARL Halfcheetah Environment
**********************

A Halfcheetah is trained to run in a given direction.
The context features can vary physical properties.

CARL Humanoid Environment
**********************

Here, a Humanoid needs to learn how to walk forward.

CARL UR5e Environment
**********************
.. image:: ../data/screenshots/ur5e.png
    :width: 25%
    :align: center

The agent needs to learn how to move a ur5e robot arm and its end effector to a sequence of targets.
The robot arm has 6 joints.

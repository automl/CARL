Environment Families
====================
In CARL we provide several contextually extended environments where we can set and augment their contexts.
With this we can analyze how the context and its augmentation influences the agent's generalization capabilities,
learning and behavior.

Although each environment has different tasks, goals and mechanics, the behavior of the dynamics and the rewards is
influenced by physical properties.

CARL currently contains the following benchmarks which are contextually extended:


Classic Control
---------------
`OpenAI gym classic control suite <https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/>`_ extended with several physics
context features like gravity or friction

Environment Families
====================
CARL consists of environments from several different environment families.
Classic Control, Box2D and Brax are physics-based simulations in roughly ascending
order of complexity, each with a few different environment variations.
The CARL Mario environment provides guided procedural context generation in games
while the RNA Design environment provides a testbed for RNA sequence design on
real-world data.

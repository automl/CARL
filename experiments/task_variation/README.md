# Task Variation
This folder contains scripts for the task variation experiments.

## Rerun Experiments
If you would like to rerun the experiments, take a look at the `runscripts` folder.
The run commands are generated such that they can be easily parallelized. 
For training, run `runscripts/run_train_task_variation.sh`, generated by `runscripts/generate_train_commands.py`.
Adjust your paths and which environment to train on accordingly.

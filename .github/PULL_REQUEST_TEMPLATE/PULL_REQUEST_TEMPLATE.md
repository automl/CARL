Good PR descriptions help us immensely in reviewing and testing your PRs. This will make merging much faster and smoother for everyone involved.
Examples:

**Good:** Added Documentation -- documented the learning rate feature both in the code and the docs. Also added an example.
**Bad:** Explained learning rates

**Good:** Dask Parallelization Backend -- parallelization is now possible with dask. This meant some restructuring of the runner backend and testing, but shouldn't change usage at all. 
**Bad:** new parallel feature
